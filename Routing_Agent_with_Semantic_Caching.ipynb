            "   - **Profit Split Method**: Allocate profits based on the contributions of each party, particularly useful for unique intangibles.\n",
            "   - **Income Approach**: Estimate the future economic benefits expected from the intangible, discounted to present value.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "5. **Documentation and Compliance**: Maintain thorough documentation of the valuation process, including methodologies, assumptions, and adjustments made to ensure compliance with the arm's length principle.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Review of Assumptions**: Regularly review and adjust the assumptions used in the valuation process to reflect changing market conditions or business strategies.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Consultation with Experts**: In complex cases, consider consulting with valuation experts to ensure the robustness and defensibility of the valuation.\n",
            "\n",
            "By following these steps, businesses can effectively evaluate intangibles in transfer pricing, ensuring that the pricing reflects the true economic value of the contributions made by each party involved.\n"
