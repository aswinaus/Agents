One significant issue is determining which entities within the group are entitled to share in the returns from exploiting intangibles, as well as identifying which entities should bear the associated costs and risks. The legal ownership of an intangible may not reflect the contributions made by other group members, complicating the compensation process under the arm's length principle.\n",

            "Additionally, valuing intangibles can be particularly difficult due to the lack of reliable methods for direct valuation. While some methods may be used to indirectly value intangibles, care must be taken to ensure that all relevant functions, risks, and assets are accurately identified and evaluated. Cost-based methods for valuing intangibles are generally discouraged, as there is often no correlation between development costs and the eventual value of the intangible.\n",
            "\n",
            "Furthermore, the unique characteristics of intangibles, such as legal protections and first mover advantages, can create comparability issues when using replacement cost valuation methods.
