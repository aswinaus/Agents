The Global Tax Platform has been authorized to be a temporary data store for both files and relational data for the expressed purpose of enabling the execution of tax preparation processes to ingest, transform, cleanse, and report on financial data. All files, however, must be synchronized with EYI MyDocs in their appropriate storage path for long\\\\-term retention.  \\r\\nFor the Global Tax Platform sub\\\\-system to facilitate the synchronization of files with EYI MyDocs, administrators must first configure connections with EYI MyDocs workspaces. Additionally, those connections must be managed throughout the life of an engagement as well as monitored. The EYI MyDocs Workspace Connection Management Dashboard provides a set of tools to manage and monitor these connectors to workspaces within EYI MyDocs.  \\r\\n<u>Stakeholders</u>:\\r\\n- Laura Fiske \\\\(TQRM\\\\)\\r\\n- Julie Moyer \\\\(EYI MyDocs\\\\)\\r\\n- Adam Ross \\\\(Common Desktop\\\\)  \\r\\n<u>Business Requirements</u>:\\r\\n- Allow for the enablement of EYI MyDocs for an engagement when being created.\\r\\n- Support the optional mapping of Jurisdictional Country of Service to an Engagement Code to establish search criteria for workspace discovery.\\r\\n- Support the selection of an EY client to be associated to workspaces where engagement code is not assigned.\\r\\n- Allow for the optional selection of a single workspace for each unique Client Number, Engagement Code, and Jurisdictional Country of Service should there exists more than one.\\r\\n- Support the assignment of an engagement code for an existing workspace connection not yet mapped to an engagement code.\\r\\n- Prevent the editing of a workspace connection already mapped to an engagement code.\\r\\n- Support the inactivation of a connection to a workspace to resolve incorrectly chosen workspaces.\\r\\n- ~~Support the Central Data Collection Model for engagements aggregating all data collected into a single country\\u2019s repository.~~\\r\\n- ~~Provision a library for each Jurisdictional Country of Service for engagements operating under the Central Data Collection Model.~~\\r\\n- ~~Enable the optional mapping of engagement codes to libraries for those created for Central Data Collection Model workspaces.~~\\r\\n- Support the selection of a workspace targeted for the Prime Country\\r\\n\\r\\n## Self\\\\-Service Workflow\\r\\n  \\r\\nThe previous minimum viable product supporting the configuration of EYI MyDocs workspaces, enabling file synchronization, provided administrators with a limited view of workspace availability and the model did not support the use of Jurisdictional Country of Service. Preliminary business solutions limited the visibility of available workspaces discovered per engagement code to one that best suited the search criteria. Additionally, workspaces were discovered or provisioned anew using the country of the member firm associated with the engagement code rather than the Jurisdictional Country of Service where financials are to be reported.  \\r\\nSolutioning for the country of member firm rather than the Jurisdictional Country of Service introduced a functional gap for documents uploaded in Gather and Deliverable Management. Not all financial reporting for an entity is done for the same country where the member firm is located. Companies who are primarily located in one country commonly report financials to multiples countries. Information Requests will request financial data specific to the country where financials are reported to prepare the deliverable for the jurisdictional tax authority for that country. So, while every member firm would have an EYI MyDocs workspace, not all documents uploaded to the GTP \\\\(Global Tax Platform\\\\) could be routed to a workspace.  \\r\\nEvolving from a minimum viable product requires the implementation of a self\\\\-service model suitable to provide administrators with the appropriate choices when configuring their workspace connections. All available workspaces that fit the search criteria, for one, must be supported as well as the flexibility to optionally map an engagement code to a Jurisdictional Country of Service to establish the search criterion. The mapping facilitates the provisioning of a new or reuse of an existing workspace for data that may be collected from countries that differ from the location of the member firm.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Newly Provisioned Engagement\\r\\n  \\r\\nAdministrators are always informed of the option to configure GTP\\\\-to\\\\-EYI MyDocs Workspace connections to synchronize documents; however, this is not mandatory for all engagements as not every engagement team will be leveraging EYI MyDocs. Some local engagement teams must accommodate data retention requirements specific to a client or jurisdictional authority that mandate the use of a different technology.![][image_b5Teu7fXbZrhbfG93ToZLQ==]   \\r\\nFollowing the creation of a new engagement either when provisioning anew or rolling forward a prior financial period, administrators are prompted to optionally configure EYI MyDocs workspaces.![][image_+eV8sNqXTcZKgEs2zs0cUw==]   \\r\\nAdministrators are brought to the workspace provisioning walkthrough where they will proceed to configure a workspace connection for each Jurisdictional Country of Service. Connections are established for new and existing EYI MyDocs workspaces. New workspaces are provisioned automatically to satisfy the connection configuration. The Global Tax Platform, however, will function regardless of whether a workspace connection exists for any given country. When a connection is not configured, documents will simply be stored in the GTP Client Site\\u2019s blob storage.\",\n",

This is accomplished by mapping EY engagements with each Jurisdictional Country of Service. EY engagement code, an EY client number, and a Jurisdictional Country of Service is necessary to perform the search. Engagement code and client number are the unique identifiers for an EY engagement. Only those EY engagements associated with the GTP engagement are available for mapping.  \\r\\nThe system will attempt to auto\\\\-assign Jurisdictional Country of Services to an EY engagement where the name of the country matches that of the Jurisdictional Country of Service. Where there are no matches or if there is more than one EY engagement that matches any one Jurisdictional Country of Service, the system will ignore the Jurisdictional Country of Service. Administrators are responsible for reviewing those Jurisdictional Country of Services auto\\\\-mapped and/or select a mapping from the list of EY engagements associated with the GTP engagement.  \\r\\nMapping a Jurisdictional Country of Service with an EY engagement is optional. Administrators who choose not to map every Jurisdictional Country of Service or, in rare cases, the GTP engagement has not been associated with an EY engagement, an EY Client must be selected. A workspace may only be provisioned for a Jurisdictional Country of Service should it have at least an EY client number assigned. The client selected may or may not be associated with the GTP engagement. Administrators have the option to search for and select any EY client, as they may not have a valid or authorized engagement code at the time of setup. Likewise, a search for existing EYI MyDocs workspaces will not be performed for any Jurisdictional Country of Service that has not been associated with an engagement code. A new workspace will always be provisioned.  \\r\\nAdministrators are navigated directly to Client Search should the GTP engagement not be associated with an EY engagement, as there is nothing to map. Discovery is also never performed.![][image_FlDxM/pXcTBCkJ+3cvMvoQ==]   \\r\\nDiscovery will be performed for countries mapped to an EY engagement. Discovery is the system\\\\-to\\\\-system search for EYI MyDocs workspaces that match each set of Engagement\\\\-Client\\\\-Jurisdictional Country of Service. Zero or more workspaces may be found for each set. Administrators may only choose one workspace for each set. Alternatively, the administrator may choose to provision a new workspace instead. The selection of an existing workspace is entirely optional.  \\r\\nWorkspaces will be provisioned under the default EY client selected in the previous step for countries not mapped to an EY engagement. Administrators have the option to change the assigned EY client if desired while configuring the workspace connections. An EY client number must be inputted and will be subsequently validated with the Global Financial Information System and EY Mercury.  \\r\\nAdministrators must choose a single workspace for the Prime Country. The Prime Country is the country of incorporation for the Global Ultimate Parent associated with the GTP Client Site. The EYI MyDocs integration requires a workspace to be selected for the Prime Country to provision a centralized client collaboration workspace.![][image_hCQtD9pqcHIQgDTQ7tctag==]   \\r\\nThe last step of the process is to save the configured connections. New workspaces will be provisioned by proxy. Administrators are then navigated to the GTP\\\\-to\\\\-EYI MyDocs Workspace Connection Management dashboard to review all GTP\\\\-to\\\\-EYI MyDocs configured connections as well as monitor any on\\\\-going provisioning processes.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Scope Changes\\r\\n  \\r\\nGTP Engagements change frequently throughout their lifetime to accommodate approved changes to scope, incrementally refine scope as new information sources are required, and to correct errors.![][image_hFFvTmu5UPiR2uktWt5xfA==]   \\r\\nChanges to the scope for an engagement may impact connections established with EYI MyDocs workspaces. Should a scope profile be removed, and the associated Jurisdictional Country of Service not included in any other scope profile, that country will no longer be available for selection when creating new Information Requests or deliverables. Documents, however, may still be uploaded to those tasks still active for the country and, therefore, the EYI MyDocs workspace will continue synchronizing files. New countries added to the scope of an engagement, however, must be handled appropriately by the administrator.![][image_0wlrcgJnq8CeXj4g62TJOA==]   \\r\\nDetermining whether action is needed on behalf of the user will depend on whether there already exists GTP\\\\-to\\\\-EYI MyDocs connections saved for the engagement and whether the changes made to the engagement resulted in a new unique Jurisdictional Country of Service appended to the scope. If there are no workspaces configured, the system does not assume EYI MyDocs is being used. Likewise, if a GTP\\\\-to\\\\-EYI MyDocs connection exists for all Jurisdictional Country of Services then the system does not assume a new workspace is required. If a new workspace is needed despite these checks passing, the administrator may navigate to the EYI MyDocs workspace management dashboard and add the workspace.\",\n",

Administrators can search for existing workspaces by mapping the Jurisdictional Country of Service to an EY engagement associated with the GTP engagement. If the administrator chooses not to map the new Jurisdictional Country of Service or the GTP engagement has no EY engagement, a default EY client must be selected. A default client may have been previously selected by the administrator, which makes searching for a new client unnecessary; however, administrators do have an option to change the client if so desired. Do note that workspace connections may only be configured for a country that does not already have an active connection. Only one connection is permitted at this time.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Assigning Engagement Code to Existing Workspace\\r\\n  \\r\\nChanges to an engagement may not impact scope but may result in changes to an existing GTP\\\\-to\\\\-EYI MyDocs workspace connection. An EY engagement newly associated with a GTP engagement can be leveraged to update an existing EYI MyDocs workspace connection. Administrators may do this to complete EYI data maintenance requirements and enable archiving.![][image_oHfUlVjeD9DTSL8EkX9Rxw==]   \\r\\nOnly those connections that are not already mapped to an EY engagement can be updated. The EYI MyDocs workspace will be altered to reflect the new engagement code and EY client number associated with the selected EY engagement.![][image_JKTKeRRRMWXNMX2U08ZZoA==]   \\r\\nThe option to edit a workspace already mapped to an engagement code is disabled by default. Changing the engagement code already mapped is not an option. Appending a new engagement code to the existing engagement may also be optional if the engagement already has the correct engagement code.![][image_Mt+XI61KjeruuYqvrEP9qw==]   \\r\\nAdministrators must save the changes for the new association to take place. Alternatively, the administrator may choose to abandon the changes.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Remediating Incorrectly Chosen Workspace\\r\\n  \\r\\nIn a situation where an incorrect workspace was chosen as part of the discovery process administrators may choose to inactivate the GTP\\\\-to\\\\-EYI MyDocs connection and proceed to reuse the Jurisdictional Country of Service for a new workspace connection \\u2013 either provisioning a new workspace or reusing a different existing workspace. Adding a different workspace does not differ from the process above.![][image_IgAuFVxmIUAPVfMN8jzNNA==]   \\r\\nA workspace inactivated by the administrator may be reactivated so long that it does not conflict with the single\\\\-workspace policy enforced for a Jurisdictional Country of Service. Only a single workspace may be active at any given time for a country. If the administrator attempts to _Activate a workspace connection for a Jurisdictional Country of Service already reserved, an error prompt is raised to inform the user of the conflict._\\r\\n\\r\\n## Product Concerns\\r\\n  \\r\\nWhile the configuration of GTP\\\\-to\\\\-EYI MyDocs connections is a process that enables synchronization of files between two platforms, the context for which the files are managed is within that of the engagement. The setup process must then intersect with that of the engagement management process; however, the execution of the setup is not consistently part of the engagement provisioning process. An engagement may be provisioned long before the team chooses to configure EYI MyDocs to manage the work to be shared with the client and to archive work following the closure of the engagement. For these reasons, EYI MyDocs workspace management is a process related to engagement management while not a mandatory process when provisioning an engagement.\\r\\n\\r\\n### EYI MyDocs Workspace Connection Dashboard\\r\\n  \\r\\nThe present version of the dashboard relies on a single endpoint within the Document Service to show those workspaces that have been provisioned for the engagement as well as those yet to be provisioned. The Workspace Connection Dashboard instead only shows those workspace connections configured for the engagement and the state of the workspace\\\\(s\\\\) monitored.![][image_cvFc2dsMjYq4s+bCigqL6g==]   \\r\\nEach row \\\\(1\\\\) shows a workspace connection configuration saved for the engagement and the state \\\\(6\\\\) of that connection. The EYI MyDocs URLs for each workspace \\\\(4\\\\) are shown for those that were successfully provisioned \\\\(3\\\\). Those currently being provisioned anew or failed to provision will not have URLs. The workspace selected for the Prime Country \\\\(5\\\\) will also be noted for transparency. Administrators can add additional connections \\\\(2\\\\) by click \\u201cAdd workspace\\u201d.![][image_HkxDHPhpWX7uRFIkpUSPSg==]   \\r\\nEach workspace connection will have a few administrative tools available to better manage the synchronization of files. Clicking the vertical ellipses \\\\(1\\\\) will expand a context menu box where administrators may add an Engagement Code \\\\(3\\\\) to a workspace connection should it not have been configured once beforehand, inactivate \\\\(2\\\\) a connection to correct an erroneous configuration, and assign a workspace for the prime country \\\\(4\\\\). Do note that at this time the selection of a workspace for a Prime Country cannot be changed once chosen.\",\n",

Depending on whether the engagement has an EY engagement associated with it, the first step of the application workflow may either be \\u201cMap engagement codes\\u201d or \\u201cChoose client\\u201d.![][image_bSVISmzNPDGd1t2td+C+AQ==]   \\r\\nShould there be at least one EDW\\\\-sourced engagement code associated with the GTP engagement \\\\(1\\\\), administrators will be afforded the option to map a single code to each unique Jurisdictional Country of Service. A list of available engagement codes will be located to the left of the page whereas a unique list of countries in scope for the engagement will appear on the right. Administrators may drag & drop \\\\(2\\\\) an engagement code to map with a country or select an engagement code \\\\(3\\\\) and click the \\u201cMap\\u201d button on the country to do the same.  \\r\\nMapping an engagement code with a Jurisdictional Country of Service establishes a search criterion to discover existing EYI MyDocs workspaces applicable to the engagement. Administrators will have the option to reuse an existing workspace or provision a new workspace as a follow\\\\-up step; however, an engagement code is required to perform the search. If an administrator chooses not to map any given Jurisdictional Country of Service with an engagement code, the system will instead provision a new workspace rather than search for existing workspaces.  \\r\\nOnly one engagement code may be associated with a Jurisdictional Country of Service; however, any given engagement code may be mapped to any number of countries. GTP\\u2019s integration with EYI MyDocs is presently limited to one active workspace connection per country for an engagement. Should administrators want different workspaces for a single country, more than one GTP engagement will be needed.  \\r\\nIf the GTP engagement was created without an association to an EY engagement, the administrator is navigated to the \\u201cChoose client\\u201d step. The \\u201cMap engagement codes\\u201d step is also disabled.![][image_FPZdrJCzsRlXJ/SrLk0dpA==]   \\r\\nThe _Choose client step enables the user to search and select a single default EY client. At minimum the EY client must be known in order to provision a new EYI MyDocs workspace; therefore, the connection configuration must include either the EY client, engagement, and Jurisdictional Country of Service or the EY Client and Jurisdictional Country of Service. Selecting a default EY client facilitates the auto\\\\-mapping of a single EY client to all countries that were not mapped with an engagement code._  \\r\\nThe system queries the Master Data Services where EDW \\\\(Enterprise Data Warehouse\\\\) client information is synchronized. Administrators may search by Client Number or Client Name and select only one. By default, a paged list of EY clients within the same organization mapped to the GTP Client Site will show. The request will only be filtered by GTP Client Site. Administrators may choose any client from the result set.![][image_Xr+F3OVNCbkO/2SObAq9Mw==]   \\r\\nEach subset of EYI MyDocs workspaces found during discovery \\\\(1\\\\) and those that must be newly provisioned \\u2013 as either no EYI MyDocs workspace was found \\\\(2\\\\) or the Jurisdictional Country of Service is not mapped to an EY engagement \\\\(3\\\\) \\u2013 will show in independent grids for selection. Only one option may be selected for each subset. If one or more workspaces were discovered for the Client\\\\-Engagement\\\\-Jurisdictional Country of Service combination, only one may be selected. Alternatively, none of the workspaces may be chosen and instead a new workspace can be provisioned.  \\r\\nWhen an existing workspace is not found, or a Jurisdictional Country of Service is unmapped, the only option is to provision a new workspace. The administrator has no option to ignore the Jurisdictional Country of Service, so the row is to be selected by default. Similarly, \\u201cCreate a new workspace\\u201d is selected by default when existing workspaces are found. Administrators, of course, have the option to change this selection.  \\r\\nAt this time, the default client assigned to an unmapped Jurisdictional Country of Service may be changed by the administrator. This is particularly useful for those GTP engagements that have consolidated several different local country teams into a broader project. Each of those teams may be working for a different client. By clicking the pencil icon next to the _Client number_, the administrator may enter a new identifier that will be validated with EDW data. The client number must exist and be the Global Ultimate Parent or a subsidiary associated with the GTP Client Site.![][image_fq729V58UYhdzspaHRsrxA==]   \\r\\nThe last step is to review and submit the engagement configuration where the Document Service will determine whether a new workspace must be provisioned. The administrator is then brought back to the Connection Management Dashboard to review the configuration and monitor the provisioning progress for each of the workspaces.\",\n",

The ideal time to create a workspace is during the pursuit stage \\u2013 an Engagement Workspace can be created, tagged as pursuit and used to store pursuit-related documentation. Once the work is won, it is quick and easy to remove the pursuit tag and add the engagement code. If a workspace has not been created during the pursuit stage, an Engagement Workspace should be created as soon as the engagement code is available and any documentation stored elsewhere should be moved into the workspace. Who is responsible for creating the workspace? Whilst the Engagement Partner is ultimately accountable, we are all responsible for ensuring best practice file documentation is achieved. Once a pursuit is underway or work is won, the engagement team should discuss and agree workspace needs and filing roles and responsibilities. The Engagement Partner or Manager will confirm the workspace details (jurisdiction, code, customizations etc) but the creation steps are likely to be performed by a junior member of the team or via a central or GDS operations team. Working practices vary per locations, please speak to your local EYI MyDocs Champions for more details \\u2013 list of global EYI MyDocs Champions [here](https://eyus.sharepoint.com/sites/EYInteract/SitePages/Additional-Support.aspx). How do I create a workspace? Please see The Essentials Flip Book and refer to the section on Workspace set-up. Many locations have centralized teams to create (or provision) workspaces. Please consult with local Tax Quality or your local EYI MyDocs implementation team or champion to determine how workspace creation and set-up is managed for your location.

How is access to a Permanent Workspace managed so that is works across all SSLs? Permanent Workspaces are intended for general client level information so remain open/access to all. It is possible to have restricted libraries if necessary. What does it mean that Active Directory groups are to be used with caution? We have an obligation under our GTCs and various EY policies to limit access to client information to those who \\\"need to know\\\", typically the engagement team. Active Directories necessarily provide access to workspaces to a broader group of people than the engagement team. While it is recognized that they are valuable where there is a group of people that are not assigned to specific clients/engagements, they should be used with care and judgement. Generally, it would not be appropriate to set up an Active Directory for all members of an SSL in a location and add the AD to Engagement Workspaces, however it could be appropriate to set up an Active Directory for new joiners only. Special care should be taken for engagements with enhanced confidentiality requirements such as transactions and engagements where we have an individual's personal sensitive data.

This includes the Jurisdictional Country of Service where financials will be reported, the services in scope and are rendered to the engaged client, and the entities for which financials will be reported and/or services rendered. Scope profiles connect all products together to offer a convenience of consistency and the power of automation.![][image_ZhZ8vmf2lp3zDViJErOX7g==]   \\r\\nDocuments are no different. When files are submitted to Information Requests or Work Products, they inherit the same context that defines a task or artifact to be prepared. This metadata is used to route the file represented by Document to the appropriate workspace. For a Client Site or Engagement, there may be dozens of applicable workspaces as each workspace is dedicated to a country. Changes made to an engagement directly impacts the availability of metadata EYI MyDocs integration is dependent on and must be managed carefully by users.![][image_eC9JIgQCuz0zLA85q5jRdQ==]   \\r\\nWhen new workspaces are discovered as would be the case when newly provisioning an engagement or scope changes, a dialog will inform the user and ask whether they would like to enable them. A call is made to the Document Service discovery endpoint to identify whether there exists any EY Workspaces for the engagement scope that have not been provisioned. The same dialog will show every time an engagement has been edited with an EY Workspace that is not provisioned to remind the user there are EY Workspaces yet to be provisioned.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Configuring Connections \\\\(Not Managing Workspaces\\\\)\\r\\n  \\r\\nAdministrators are configuring, managing, and monitoring connections to EYI MyDocs workspaces rather than managing workspaces. Users must be in EYI MyDocs to manage workspaces. As such, the tools available to administrators focus on the activities related to administering those connections that have been established or are desired.  \\r\\n<u>Configuring EYI </u><u>MyDocs</u><u> Workspace </u><u>C</u><u>onnections</u>![][image_w65U4TdSNvjtCRqcWB4kWA==]   \\r\\nWorkspace connections provide administrators with a mode of establishing and managing the synchronization of files from GTP to EYI MyDocs.

Each workspace \\\\(1\\\\) will be new for newly provisioned engagements, as they are unique to the GTP engagement, engagement code, client number, and jurisdiction.  \\r\\nNew workspaces found are identified as those with an EY Workspace that has yet to be provisioned \\\\(2\\\\). Those rows should be clearly indicated as new workspaces. For those countries added as part of the engagement\\u2019s scope, they must be paired with a prime engagement selected by the user. A \\u201cprime\\u201d \\\\(3\\\\) must be selected by the user to proceed with provisioning the workspaces. The button to submit changes made is to be disabled until a \\u201cprime\\u201d is selected.  \\r\\nEach Jurisdictional Country of Service is sent with the client number for prime \\\\(4\\\\) so that workspace\\\\(s\\\\) may be provisioned. The engagement code will remain empty for these Jurisdictional Country of Services. Duplicate client\\\\-country pairs are not permitted, so when a Jurisdictional Country of Service matches that of the jurisdiction associated with the \\u201cprime\\u201d workspace we exclude it from the list.  \\r\\nOnce a \\u201cprime\\u201d is selected and submitted, it may no longer be changed by the user. Users will be required to escalate changes needed to Production Support where Team Nimbus and the EYI MyDocs team will reconcile the changes required for the user. This is a manual process until a workflow is identified to support changing a \\u201cprime\\u201d.  \\r\\n<u>Managing Existing Connections</u>  \\r\\nEY engagements as well as new scope will be added from time\\\\-to\\\\-time, which will require additional connections to workspaces and / or libraries dedicated for those clients and / or countries. Engagement Codes and scope will be adjusted, changed, or removed entirely, which will impact existing connections. Changes to the engagement must be accounted for as part of EYI MyDocs connection management.  \\r\\n_New Scope Appended to Engagement_![][image_RAvWI/cerqnCQxrqTbyn3g==]   \\r\\nMuch like newly provisioned engagements, administrators are presented with newly discovered workspaces following the addition of one or more engagement codes or scope profiles where they may add them to the existing list of connections. The application flow is no different.  \\r\\n_Scope Changes Impacting Connections_![][image_i0fbscPSIFB3+YMHJ5bsVA==]   \\r\\nWhen scope changes, those changes may impact existing connections. There are three typical administrative functions that will result in an existing connection no longer being applicable:\\r\\n- Engagement code is removed from an existing engagement\\r\\n<comment_thread>\\r\\n<comment author=\\\"Matthew J Pettit\\\" timestamp=\\\"2022-03-03T13:59:57Z\\\">\\r\\nEvents that must automatically inactivate an existing connection.\\r\\n</comment>\\r\\n</comment_thread>\\r\\n- Jurisdictional Country of Service is changed for an existing scope profile\\r\\n- Scope profile is removed from an existing engagement  \\r\\nShould any of these activities take place, a corresponding connection affected by the changes must be deactivated. This is simply setting the status of the connection to \\u201cInactive\\u201d. This stops the synchronization of data to the workspace targeted for the connection. The connection, however, must remain visible to administrators, as files may exist in this location. Team Nimbus is responsible for managing these change events.  \\r\\n_Prime Workspace_  \\r\\n_Users may not change a \\u201cprime\\u201d following initial configuration. The radial buttons are disabled whenever a response is provided from the Document Service endpoint that indicates a \\u201cisPrimary\\u201d engagement. The configured \\u201cprime\\u201d will continue to show on the grid to help users understand where files are transferred. This is also the case should an engagement code assigned as the \\u201cprime\\u201d is removed. The \\u201cprime\\u201d will continue to show as it will be included in the response from the Document Service endpoint and will remain as the sole location for all Jurisdictional Country of Services._  \\r\\n<u>Remediating Connection Issues</u>  \\r\\nProduction Support will receive reports that the EYI MyDocs connections configured are not working as expected. This may be a result of,\\r\\n- Synchronization delays because of a lengthy queue, the size of the file\\\\(s\\\\) transferring, or general latency.\\r\\n- Errors surfacing due to a missing EYI MyDocs workspace connection\\\\(s\\\\) or an application defect.\\r\\n- Failed synchronization of files due to in\\\\-progress or failed provisioning of workspaces and / or libraries, loss of connectivity, improper configuration, or an application defect.\\r\\n- Missing files or files not appearing where the user had expected them to appear because of an incorrectly provisioned workspace, improper association of an engagement code to the engagement, or an application defect.  \\r\\nAdministrators and Production Support will require the information necessary and easily available to triage these reported incidents. The workspace management dashboard must show the state of each workspace targeted by a connection, whether an unusual number of synchronization errors have been raised recently, and functionality to correct these configuration issues in a self\\\\-service manner.\",\n",

The administrator should not be shown ambiguous application error messages that cannot be acted upon.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Architecture\\r\\n![][image_0RyXAJ7qfqMjUmElrgJZrg==]   \\r\\nThe dashboard retrieves referential information to guide the application flow where that data is then leveraged to retrieve EYI MyDocs workspaces provisioned or to be provisioned via the Document Service. The response is rendered within a data grid where the workspace may be added to a list of connectors for the engagement. Should the target workspace not exist, the Document Service will invoke the provisioning process to create it. The connector may then be altered to include third\\\\-party workspaces where the changes are resubmitted to the Document Service to initiate further provisioning activities for those new workspaces.  \\r\\nChanges to an engagement is consumed by the Document Service via ASB messaging to determine whether an existing connector must be disabled.  \\r\\n<u>Workspace Discovery & Provisioning</u><u> Sequence Diagram</u>  \\r\\nEYI MyDocs Workspace Connectors are created within the context of an individual engagement and not the Client Site. The engagement thus must be first retrieved to acquire the associated engagement codes, which serves as the baseline parameters leveraged to discover existing and needed EYI MyDocs workspaces via the Document Service.![][image_+y3M/VZNFjxEi1E7DHfXdg==]   \\r\\nFollowing the selection of the \\u201cPrime\\u201d, all countries \\\\(a.k.a. Jurisdictional Country of Service\\\\) across all scope profiles are rolled up into the \\u201cPrime\\u201d to leverage the Client Number while ignoring the Engagement Code. The list is retrieved from the Engagement Service. Submitting the configuration is akin to submitting a provisioning request. The Document Service stores the workspace connector configuration for the GTP engagement, to be retrieved at any time, and proxies a provisioning request to EYI MyDocs API.  \\r\\nOnce one or more connectors are created within the Global Tax Platform, the Document Service manages the connector rather than the workspace. Retrieval of workspace connectors and their relevant information will be done via the Document Service without interaction with EYI MyDocs; however, should this data change in any way ancillary processes may be invoked to reconcile the target workspaces with the new configuration. The connectors will be used to synchronize files between GTP and EYI MyDocs. The provisioning of workspaces and the synchronization of data is outside the scope of this solution.  \\r\\n<u>Discover Workspaces</u>\\r\\n- Document Service \\\\(v3\\\\)\\r\\n- /provisioning/engagements/\\\\{engagementId\\\\}/workspaces\\r\\n- Parameters\\r\\n- engagementId \\u2013 Identity of the GTP engagement\\r\\n- clientId \\u2013 Identity of the GTP Client Site\\r\\n- Request:  \\r\\n\\\\{  \\r\\n  \\\"taxEngagements\\\": \\\\[  \\r\\n    \\\\{  \\r\\n      \\\"taxClientNumber\\\": \\\"string\\\",  \\r\\n      \\\"taxEngagementCode\\\": \\\"string\\\",  \\r\\n      \\\"jurisdiction\\\": \\\"string\\\"  \\r\\n    \\\\}  \\r\\n  \\\\]  \\r\\n\\\\}\\r\\n- Response:  \\r\\n\\\\{  \\r\\n  \\\"gtpEngagementId\\\": \\\"3fa85f64\\\\-5717\\\\-4562\\\\-b3fc\\\\-2c963f66afa6\\\",  \\r\\n  \\\"gtpClientId\\\": 0,  \\r\\n  \\\"sites\\\": \\\\[  \\r\\n    \\\\{  \\r\\n      \\\"isPrimary\\\": true,  \\r\\n      \\\"isRedbox\\\": true,  \\r\\n      \\\"taxClientNumber\\\": \\\"string\\\",  \\r\\n      \\\"engagementCode\\\": \\\"string\\\",  \\r\\n      \\\"jurisdiction\\\": \\\"string\\\",  \\r\\n      \\\"engagementWorkspaces\\\": \\\\[  \\r\\n        \\\\{  \\r\\n          \\\"siteUrl\\\": \\\"string\\\",  \\r\\n          \\\"engagementLibrary\\\": \\\"string\\\",  \\r\\n          \\\"clientWorkspaces\\\": \\\\[  \\r\\n            \\\\{  \\r\\n              \\\"siteUrl\\\": \\\"string\\\",  \\r\\n              \\\"clientLibrary\\\": \\\"string\\\"  \\r\\n            \\\\}  \\r\\n          \\\\],  \\r\\n          \\\"thirdPartyWorkspaces\\\": \\\\[  \\r\\n            \\\\{  \\r\\n              \\\"siteUrl\\\": \\\"string\\\",  \\r\\n              \\\"thirdPartyLibrary\\\": \\\"string\\\"  \\r\\n            \\\\}  \\r\\n          \\\\]  \\r\\n        \\\\}  \\r\\n      \\\\],  \\r\\n      \\\"isNewEws\\\": true,  \\r\\n      \\\"isNewCws\\\": true  \\r\\n    \\\\}  \\r\\n  \\\\]  \\r\\n\\\\}  \\r\\n<u>Save Connectors</u>\\r\\n- Document Service \\\\(v3\\\\)\\r\\n- /provisioning/engagements\\r\\n- Parameters\\r\\n- ClientId \\u2013 Identity of the GTP Client Site\\r\\n- Request:  \\r\\n\\\\{  \\r\\n  \\\"gtpEngagementId\\\": \\\"3fa85f64\\\\-5717\\\\-4562\\\\-b3fc\\\\-2c963f66afa6\\\",  \\r\\n  \\\"gtpClientId\\\": 0,  \\r\\n  \\\"sites\\\": \\\\[  \\r\\n    \\\\{\",\n",

The Global Tax Platform has been authorized to be a temporary data store for both files and relational data for the expressed purpose of enabling the execution of tax preparation processes to ingest, transform, cleanse, and report on financial data. All files, however, must be synchronized with EYI MyDocs in their appropriate storage path for long\\\\-term retention.  \\r\\nFor the Global Tax Platform sub\\\\-system to facilitate the synchronization of files with EYI MyDocs, administrators must first configure connections with EYI MyDocs workspaces. Additionally, those connections must be managed throughout the life of an engagement as well as monitored. The EYI MyDocs Workspace Connection Management Dashboard provides a set of tools to manage and monitor these connectors to workspaces within EYI MyDocs.  \\r\\n<u>Stakeholders</u>:\\r\\n- Laura Fiske \\\\(TQRM\\\\)\\r\\n- Julie Moyer \\\\(EYI MyDocs\\\\)\\r\\n- Adam Ross \\\\(Common Desktop\\\\)  \\r\\n<u>Business Requirements</u>:\\r\\n- Allow for the enablement of EYI MyDocs for an engagement when being created.\\r\\n- Support the optional mapping of Jurisdictional Country of Service to an Engagement Code to establish search criteria for workspace discovery.\\r\\n- Support the selection of an EY client to be associated to workspaces where engagement code is not assigned.\\r\\n- Allow for the optional selection of a single workspace for each unique Client Number, Engagement Code, and Jurisdictional Country of Service should there exists more than one.\\r\\n- Support the assignment of an engagement code for an existing workspace connection not yet mapped to an engagement code.\\r\\n- Prevent the editing of a workspace connection already mapped to an engagement code.\\r\\n- Support the inactivation of a connection to a workspace to resolve incorrectly chosen workspaces.\\r\\n- ~~Support the Central Data Collection Model for engagements aggregating all data collected into a single country\\u2019s repository.~~\\r\\n- ~~Provision a library for each Jurisdictional Country of Service for engagements operating under the Central Data Collection Model.~~\\r\\n- ~~Enable the optional mapping of engagement codes to libraries for those created for Central Data Collection Model workspaces.~~\\r\\n- Support the selection of a workspace targeted for the Prime Country\\r\\n\\r\\n## Self\\\\-Service Workflow\\r\\n  \\r\\nThe previous minimum viable product supporting the configuration of EYI MyDocs workspaces, enabling file synchronization, provided administrators with a limited view of workspace availability and the model did not support the use of Jurisdictional Country of Service. Preliminary business solutions limited the visibility of available workspaces discovered per engagement code to one that best suited the search criteria. Additionally, workspaces were discovered or provisioned anew using the country of the member firm associated with the engagement code rather than the Jurisdictional Country of Service where financials are to be reported.  \\r\\nSolutioning for the country of member firm rather than the Jurisdictional Country of Service introduced a functional gap for documents uploaded in Gather and Deliverable Management. Not all financial reporting for an entity is done for the same country where the member firm is located. Companies who are primarily located in one country commonly report financials to multiples countries. Information Requests will request financial data specific to the country where financials are reported to prepare the deliverable for the jurisdictional tax authority for that country. So, while every member firm would have an EYI MyDocs workspace, not all documents uploaded to the GTP \\\\(Global Tax Platform\\\\) could be routed to a workspace.  \\r\\nEvolving from a minimum viable product requires the implementation of a self\\\\-service model suitable to provide administrators with the appropriate choices when configuring their workspace connections. All available workspaces that fit the search criteria, for one, must be supported as well as the flexibility to optionally map an engagement code to a Jurisdictional Country of Service to establish the search criterion. The mapping facilitates the provisioning of a new or reuse of an existing workspace for data that may be collected from countries that differ from the location of the member firm.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Newly Provisioned Engagement\\r\\n  \\r\\nAdministrators are always informed of the option to configure GTP\\\\-to\\\\-EYI MyDocs Workspace connections to synchronize documents; however, this is not mandatory for all engagements as not every engagement team will be leveraging EYI MyDocs. Some local engagement teams must accommodate data retention requirements specific to a client or jurisdictional authority that mandate the use of a different technology.![][image_b5Teu7fXbZrhbfG93ToZLQ==]   \\r\\nFollowing the creation of a new engagement either when provisioning anew or rolling forward a prior financial period, administrators are prompted to optionally configure EYI MyDocs workspaces.![][image_+eV8sNqXTcZKgEs2zs0cUw==]   \\r\\nAdministrators are brought to the workspace provisioning walkthrough where they will proceed to configure a workspace connection for each Jurisdictional Country of Service. Connections are established for new and existing EYI MyDocs workspaces. New workspaces are provisioned automatically to satisfy the connection configuration. The Global Tax Platform, however, will function regardless of whether a workspace connection exists for any given country. When a connection is not configured, documents will simply be stored in the GTP Client Site\\u2019s blob storage.\",\n",

This is accomplished by mapping EY engagements with each Jurisdictional Country of Service. EY engagement code, an EY client number, and a Jurisdictional Country of Service is necessary to perform the search. Engagement code and client number are the unique identifiers for an EY engagement. Only those EY engagements associated with the GTP engagement are available for mapping.  \\r\\nThe system will attempt to auto\\\\-assign Jurisdictional Country of Services to an EY engagement where the name of the country matches that of the Jurisdictional Country of Service. Where there are no matches or if there is more than one EY engagement that matches any one Jurisdictional Country of Service, the system will ignore the Jurisdictional Country of Service. Administrators are responsible for reviewing those Jurisdictional Country of Services auto\\\\-mapped and/or select a mapping from the list of EY engagements associated with the GTP engagement.  \\r\\nMapping a Jurisdictional Country of Service with an EY engagement is optional. Administrators who choose not to map every Jurisdictional Country of Service or, in rare cases, the GTP engagement has not been associated with an EY engagement, an EY Client must be selected. A workspace may only be provisioned for a Jurisdictional Country of Service should it have at least an EY client number assigned. The client selected may or may not be associated with the GTP engagement. Administrators have the option to search for and select any EY client, as they may not have a valid or authorized engagement code at the time of setup. Likewise, a search for existing EYI MyDocs workspaces will not be performed for any Jurisdictional Country of Service that has not been associated with an engagement code. A new workspace will always be provisioned.  \\r\\nAdministrators are navigated directly to Client Search should the GTP engagement not be associated with an EY engagement, as there is nothing to map. Discovery is also never performed.![][image_FlDxM/pXcTBCkJ+3cvMvoQ==]   \\r\\nDiscovery will be performed for countries mapped to an EY engagement. Discovery is the system\\\\-to\\\\-system search for EYI MyDocs workspaces that match each set of Engagement\\\\-Client\\\\-Jurisdictional Country of Service. Zero or more workspaces may be found for each set. Administrators may only choose one workspace for each set. Alternatively, the administrator may choose to provision a new workspace instead. The selection of an existing workspace is entirely optional.  \\r\\nWorkspaces will be provisioned under the default EY client selected in the previous step for countries not mapped to an EY engagement. Administrators have the option to change the assigned EY client if desired while configuring the workspace connections. An EY client number must be inputted and will be subsequently validated with the Global Financial Information System and EY Mercury.  \\r\\nAdministrators must choose a single workspace for the Prime Country. The Prime Country is the country of incorporation for the Global Ultimate Parent associated with the GTP Client Site. The EYI MyDocs integration requires a workspace to be selected for the Prime Country to provision a centralized client collaboration workspace.![][image_hCQtD9pqcHIQgDTQ7tctag==]   \\r\\nThe last step of the process is to save the configured connections. New workspaces will be provisioned by proxy. Administrators are then navigated to the GTP\\\\-to\\\\-EYI MyDocs Workspace Connection Management dashboard to review all GTP\\\\-to\\\\-EYI MyDocs configured connections as well as monitor any on\\\\-going provisioning processes.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Scope Changes\\r\\n  \\r\\nGTP Engagements change frequently throughout their lifetime to accommodate approved changes to scope, incrementally refine scope as new information sources are required, and to correct errors.![][image_hFFvTmu5UPiR2uktWt5xfA==]   \\r\\nChanges to the scope for an engagement may impact connections established with EYI MyDocs workspaces. Should a scope profile be removed, and the associated Jurisdictional Country of Service not included in any other scope profile, that country will no longer be available for selection when creating new Information Requests or deliverables. Documents, however, may still be uploaded to those tasks still active for the country and, therefore, the EYI MyDocs workspace will continue synchronizing files. New countries added to the scope of an engagement, however, must be handled appropriately by the administrator.![][image_0wlrcgJnq8CeXj4g62TJOA==]   \\r\\nDetermining whether action is needed on behalf of the user will depend on whether there already exists GTP\\\\-to\\\\-EYI MyDocs connections saved for the engagement and whether the changes made to the engagement resulted in a new unique Jurisdictional Country of Service appended to the scope. If there are no workspaces configured, the system does not assume EYI MyDocs is being used. Likewise, if a GTP\\\\-to\\\\-EYI MyDocs connection exists for all Jurisdictional Country of Services then the system does not assume a new workspace is required. If a new workspace is needed despite these checks passing, the administrator may navigate to the EYI MyDocs workspace management dashboard and add the workspace.\",\n",

Administrators can search for existing workspaces by mapping the Jurisdictional Country of Service to an EY engagement associated with the GTP engagement. If the administrator chooses not to map the new Jurisdictional Country of Service or the GTP engagement has no EY engagement, a default EY client must be selected. A default client may have been previously selected by the administrator, which makes searching for a new client unnecessary; however, administrators do have an option to change the client if so desired. Do note that workspace connections may only be configured for a country that does not already have an active connection. Only one connection is permitted at this time.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Assigning Engagement Code to Existing Workspace\\r\\n  \\r\\nChanges to an engagement may not impact scope but may result in changes to an existing GTP\\\\-to\\\\-EYI MyDocs workspace connection. An EY engagement newly associated with a GTP engagement can be leveraged to update an existing EYI MyDocs workspace connection. Administrators may do this to complete EYI data maintenance requirements and enable archiving.![][image_oHfUlVjeD9DTSL8EkX9Rxw==]   \\r\\nOnly those connections that are not already mapped to an EY engagement can be updated.

Changing the engagement code already mapped is not an option. Appending a new engagement code to the existing engagement may also be optional if the engagement already has the correct engagement code.![][image_Mt+XI61KjeruuYqvrEP9qw==]   \\r\\nAdministrators must save the changes for the new association to take place. Alternatively, the administrator may choose to abandon the changes.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Remediating Incorrectly Chosen Workspace\\r\\n  \\r\\nIn a situation where an incorrect workspace was chosen as part of the discovery process administrators may choose to inactivate the GTP\\\\-to\\\\-EYI MyDocs connection and proceed to reuse the Jurisdictional Country of Service for a new workspace connection \\u2013 either provisioning a new workspace or reusing a different existing workspace. Adding a different workspace does not differ from the process above.![][image_IgAuFVxmIUAPVfMN8jzNNA==]   \\r\\nA workspace inactivated by the administrator may be reactivated so long that it does not conflict with the single\\\\-workspace policy enforced for a Jurisdictional Country of Service. Only a single workspace may be active at any given time for a country. If the administrator attempts to _Activate a workspace connection for a Jurisdictional Country of Service already reserved, an error prompt is raised to inform the user of the conflict._\\r\\n\\r\\n## Product Concerns\\r\\n  \\r\\nWhile the configuration of GTP\\\\-to\\\\-EYI MyDocs connections is a process that enables synchronization of files between two platforms, the context for which the files are managed is within that of the engagement. The setup process must then intersect with that of the engagement management process; however, the execution of the setup is not consistently part of the engagement provisioning process. An engagement may be provisioned long before the team chooses to configure EYI MyDocs to manage the work to be shared with the client and to archive work following the closure of the engagement. For these reasons, EYI MyDocs workspace management is a process related to engagement management while not a mandatory process when provisioning an engagement.\\r\\n\\r\\n### EYI MyDocs Workspace Connection Dashboard\\r\\n  \\r\\nThe present version of the dashboard relies on a single endpoint within the Document Service to show those workspaces that have been provisioned for the engagement as well as those yet to be provisioned. The Workspace Connection Dashboard instead only shows those workspace connections configured for the engagement and the state of the workspace\\\\(s\\\\) monitored.![][image_cvFc2dsMjYq4s+bCigqL6g==]   \\r\\nEach row \\\\(1\\\\) shows a workspace connection configuration saved for the engagement and the state \\\\(6\\\\) of that connection.

Administrators will have the option to reuse an existing workspace or provision a new workspace as a follow\\\\-up step; however, an engagement code is required to perform the search. If an administrator chooses not to map any given Jurisdictional Country of Service with an engagement code, the system will instead provision a new workspace rather than search for existing workspaces.  \\r\\nOnly one engagement code may be associated with a Jurisdictional Country of Service; however, any given engagement code may be mapped to any number of countries. GTP\\u2019s integration with EYI MyDocs is presently limited to one active workspace connection per country for an engagement.

Selecting a default EY client facilitates the auto\\\\-mapping of a single EY client to all countries that were not mapped with an engagement code._  \\r\\nThe system queries the Master Data Services where EDW \\\\(Enterprise Data Warehouse\\\\) client information is synchronized. Administrators may search by Client Number or Client Name and select only one. By default, a paged list of EY clients within the same organization mapped to the GTP Client Site will show. The request will only be filtered by GTP Client Site.

Only one option may be selected for each subset. If one or more workspaces were discovered for the Client\\\\-Engagement\\\\-Jurisdictional Country of Service combination, only one may be selected. Alternatively, none of the workspaces may be chosen and instead a new workspace can be provisioned.  \\r\\nWhen an existing workspace is not found, or a Jurisdictional Country of Service is unmapped, the only option is to provision a new workspace.

Similarly, \\u201cCreate a new workspace\\u201d is selected by default when existing workspaces are found. Administrators, of course, have the option to change this selection.  \\r\\nAt this time, the default client assigned to an unmapped Jurisdictional Country of Service may be changed by the administrator. This is particularly useful for those GTP engagements that have consolidated several different local country teams into a broader project. Each of those teams may be working for a different client. By clicking the pencil icon next to the _Client number_, the administrator may enter a new identifier that will be validated with EDW data.

The ideal time to create a workspace is during the pursuit stage \\u2013 an Engagement Workspace can be created, tagged as pursuit and used to store pursuit-related documentation. Once the work is won, it is quick and easy to remove the pursuit tag and add the engagement code. If a workspace has not been created during the pursuit stage, an Engagement Workspace should be created as soon as the engagement code is available and any documentation stored elsewhere should be moved into the workspace. Who is responsible for creating the workspace? Whilst the Engagement Partner is ultimately accountable, we are all responsible for ensuring best practice file documentation is achieved. Once a pursuit is underway or work is won, the engagement team should discuss and agree workspace needs and filing roles and responsibilities. The Engagement Partner or Manager will confirm the workspace details (jurisdiction, code, customizations etc) but the creation steps are likely to be performed by a junior member of the team or via a central or GDS operations team. Working practices vary per locations, please speak to your local EYI MyDocs Champions for more details \\u2013 list of global EYI MyDocs Champions [here](https://eyus.sharepoint.com/sites/EYInteract/SitePages/Additional-Support.aspx). How do I create a workspace? Please see The Essentials Flip Book and refer to the section on Workspace set-up. Many locations have centralized teams to create (or provision) workspaces. Please consult with local Tax Quality or your local EYI MyDocs implementation team or champion to determine how workspace creation and set-up is managed for your location.

How is access to a Permanent Workspace managed so that is works across all SSLs? Permanent Workspaces are intended for general client level information so remain open/access to all. It is possible to have restricted libraries if necessary. What does it mean that Active Directory groups are to be used with caution? We have an obligation under our GTCs and various EY policies to limit access to client information to those who \\\"need to know\\\", typically the engagement team. Active Directories necessarily provide access to workspaces to a broader group of people than the engagement team. While it is recognized that they are valuable where there is a group of people that are not assigned to specific clients/engagements, they should be used with care and judgement. Generally, it would not be appropriate to set up an Active Directory for all members of an SSL in a location and add the AD to Engagement Workspaces, however it could be appropriate to set up an Active Directory for new joiners only. Special care should be taken for engagements with enhanced confidentiality requirements such as transactions and engagements where we have an individual's personal sensitive data.

The Global Tax Platform has been authorized to be a temporary data store for both files and relational data for the expressed purpose of enabling the execution of tax preparation processes to ingest, transform, cleanse, and report on financial data. All files, however, must be synchronized to EYI MyDocs in their appropriate file storage path for long\\\\-term retention.  \\r\\nFor the Global Tax Platform sub\\\\-system to facilitate the synchronization of files to EYI MyDocs, administrators must first configure connections with EY, client, and third\\\\-party workspaces. Additionally, those connections must be managed throughout the life of an engagement as well as monitored. The EYI MyDocs Workspace Management Dashboard provides a robust set of tools to manage and monitor these connectors to external workspaces within EYI MyDocs.  \\r\\n<u>Stakeholders</u>:\\r\\n- Laura Fiske \\\\(TQRM\\\\)\\r\\n- Julie Moyer \\\\(EYI MyDocs\\\\)\\r\\n- Tim Foster \\\\(APAC CIT / NCIT\\\\)\\r\\n- Matthew Kubacki \\\\(NCIT Solution\\\\)\\r\\n- Paul Lockwood \\\\(U.S. CIT\\\\)\\r\\n- Geert Vandenplas \\\\(VAT\\\\)  \\r\\n<u>Business Requirements</u>:\\r\\n- \\\\[E\\\\-958\\\\-1\\\\] The ability to create a set of standard, default folders within the Document\\\\-management solution that is being used by GTP to cater for document\\\\-retention and archiving. \\\\(NCIT\\\\)\\r\\n- \\\\[E\\\\-988\\\\-2\\\\] Ability for an EY User to create a folder or a sub\\\\-folder, on an ad\\\\-hoc basis, within the Document\\\\-management solution that is being used by GTP to cater for document\\\\-retention and archiving. \\\\(NCIT\\\\)\\r\\n- Third\\\\-Pary users must have access to their independent workspaces provisioned via the GTP. \\\\(EYI\\\\)\\r\\n- Not all engagement codes will be known, so users must be able to provision workspaces with only the client number associated with the country of the prime engagement and the Jurisdictional Country of Service. \\\\(EYI\\\\)  \\r\\n<u>User Journeys</u>:![][image_TH9U/MtgwENN75Otaezepw==] \\r\\n\\r\\n### Engagement Management\\r\\n  \\r\\nEngagement administrative function within the Global Tax Platform \\\\(GTP\\\\) has a strong correlation with the capabilities necessary to configure EYI MyDocs connectivity. This correlation lies with scope profiles. An engagement allows administrators to govern the context for which resources may be created. This includes the Jurisdictional Country of Service where financials will be reported, the services in scope and are rendered to the engaged client, and the entities for which financials will be reported and/or services rendered. Scope profiles connect all products together to offer a convenience of consistency and the power of automation.![][image_ZhZ8vmf2lp3zDViJErOX7g==]   \\r\\nDocuments are no different. When files are submitted to Information Requests or Work Products, they inherit the same context that defines a task or artifact to be prepared. This metadata is used to route the file represented by Document to the appropriate workspace. For a Client Site or Engagement, there may be dozens of applicable workspaces as each workspace is dedicated to a country. Changes made to an engagement directly impacts the availability of metadata EYI MyDocs integration is dependent on and must be managed carefully by users.![][image_eC9JIgQCuz0zLA85q5jRdQ==]   \\r\\nWhen new workspaces are discovered as would be the case when newly provisioning an engagement or scope changes, a dialog will inform the user and ask whether they would like to enable them. A call is made to the Document Service discovery endpoint to identify whether there exists any EY Workspaces for the engagement scope that have not been provisioned. The same dialog will show every time an engagement has been edited with an EY Workspace that is not provisioned to remind the user there are EY Workspaces yet to be provisioned.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Configuring Connections \\\\(Not Managing Workspaces\\\\)\\r\\n  \\r\\nAdministrators are configuring, managing, and monitoring connections to EYI MyDocs workspaces rather than managing workspaces. Users must be in EYI MyDocs to manage workspaces. As such, the tools available to administrators focus on the activities related to administering those connections that have been established or are desired.  \\r\\n<u>Configuring EYI </u><u>MyDocs</u><u> Workspace </u><u>C</u><u>onnections</u>![][image_w65U4TdSNvjtCRqcWB4kWA==]   \\r\\nWorkspace connections provide administrators with a mode of establishing and managing the synchronization of files from GTP to EYI MyDocs.

Each workspace \\\\(1\\\\) will be new for newly provisioned engagements, as they are unique to the GTP engagement, engagement code, client number, and jurisdiction.  \\r\\nNew workspaces found are identified as those with an EY Workspace that has yet to be provisioned \\\\(2\\\\). Those rows should be clearly indicated as new workspaces. For those countries added as part of the engagement\\u2019s scope, they must be paired with a prime engagement selected by the user. A \\u201cprime\\u201d \\\\(3\\\\) must be selected by the user to proceed with provisioning the workspaces. The button to submit changes made is to be disabled until a \\u201cprime\\u201d is selected.  \\r\\nEach Jurisdictional Country of Service is sent with the client number for prime \\\\(4\\\\) so that workspace\\\\(s\\\\) may be provisioned. The engagement code will remain empty for these Jurisdictional Country of Services. Duplicate client\\\\-country pairs are not permitted, so when a Jurisdictional Country of Service matches that of the jurisdiction associated with the \\u201cprime\\u201d workspace we exclude it from the list.  \\r\\nOnce a \\u201cprime\\u201d is selected and submitted, it may no longer be changed by the user. Users will be required to escalate changes needed to Production Support where Team Nimbus and the EYI MyDocs team will reconcile the changes required for the user. This is a manual process until a workflow is identified to support changing a \\u201cprime\\u201d.  \\r\\n<u>Managing Existing Connections</u>  \\r\\nEY engagements as well as new scope will be added from time\\\\-to\\\\-time, which will require additional connections to workspaces and / or libraries dedicated for those clients and / or countries. Engagement Codes and scope will be adjusted, changed, or removed entirely, which will impact existing connections. Changes to the engagement must be accounted for as part of EYI MyDocs connection management.  \\r\\n_New Scope Appended to Engagement_![][image_RAvWI/cerqnCQxrqTbyn3g==]   \\r\\nMuch like newly provisioned engagements, administrators are presented with newly discovered workspaces following the addition of one or more engagement codes or scope profiles where they may add them to the existing list of connections. The application flow is no different.  \\r\\n_Scope Changes Impacting Connections_![][image_i0fbscPSIFB3+YMHJ5bsVA==]   \\r\\nWhen scope changes, those changes may impact existing connections. There are three typical administrative functions that will result in an existing connection no longer being applicable:\\r\\n- Engagement code is removed from an existing engagement\\r\\n<comment_thread>\\r\\n<comment author=\\\"Matthew J Pettit\\\" timestamp=\\\"2022-03-03T13:59:57Z\\\">\\r\\nEvents that must automatically inactivate an existing connection.\\r\\n</comment>\\r\\n</comment_thread>\\r\\n- Jurisdictional Country of Service is changed for an existing scope profile\\r\\n- Scope profile is removed from an existing engagement  \\r\\nShould any of these activities take place, a corresponding connection affected by the changes must be deactivated. This is simply setting the status of the connection to \\u201cInactive\\u201d. This stops the synchronization of data to the workspace targeted for the connection. The connection, however, must remain visible to administrators, as files may exist in this location. Team Nimbus is responsible for managing these change events.  \\r\\n_Prime Workspace_  \\r\\n_Users may not change a \\u201cprime\\u201d following initial configuration. The radial buttons are disabled whenever a response is provided from the Document Service endpoint that indicates a \\u201cisPrimary\\u201d engagement. The configured \\u201cprime\\u201d will continue to show on the grid to help users understand where files are transferred. This is also the case should an engagement code assigned as the \\u201cprime\\u201d is removed. The \\u201cprime\\u201d will continue to show as it will be included in the response from the Document Service endpoint and will remain as the sole location for all Jurisdictional Country of Services._  \\r\\n<u>Remediating Connection Issues</u>  \\r\\nProduction Support will receive reports that the EYI MyDocs connections configured are not working as expected. This may be a result of,\\r\\n- Synchronization delays because of a lengthy queue, the size of the file\\\\(s\\\\) transferring, or general latency.\\r\\n- Errors surfacing due to a missing EYI MyDocs workspace connection\\\\(s\\\\) or an application defect.\\r\\n- Failed synchronization of files due to in\\\\-progress or failed provisioning of workspaces and / or libraries, loss of connectivity, improper configuration, or an application defect.\\r\\n- Missing files or files not appearing where the user had expected them to appear because of an incorrectly provisioned workspace, improper association of an engagement code to the engagement, or an application defect.  \\r\\nAdministrators and Production Support will require the information necessary and easily available to triage these reported incidents.

Production Support with the support of Team Nimbus and EYI MyDocs will need to investigate the causes of the failure. The administrator should not be shown ambiguous application error messages that cannot be acted upon.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Architecture\\r\\n![][image_0RyXAJ7qfqMjUmElrgJZrg==]   \\r\\nThe dashboard retrieves referential information to guide the application flow where that data is then leveraged to retrieve EYI MyDocs workspaces provisioned or to be provisioned via the Document Service. The response is rendered within a data grid where the workspace may be added to a list of connectors for the engagement. Should the target workspace not exist, the Document Service will invoke the provisioning process to create it. The connector may then be altered to include third\\\\-party workspaces where the changes are resubmitted to the Document Service to initiate further provisioning activities for those new workspaces.  \\r\\nChanges to an engagement is consumed by the Document Service via ASB messaging to determine whether an existing connector must be disabled.  \\r\\n<u>Workspace Discovery & Provisioning</u><u> Sequence Diagram</u>  \\r\\nEYI MyDocs Workspace Connectors are created within the context of an individual engagement and not the Client Site. The engagement thus must be first retrieved to acquire the associated engagement codes, which serves as the baseline parameters leveraged to discover existing and needed EYI MyDocs workspaces via the Document Service.![][image_+y3M/VZNFjxEi1E7DHfXdg==]   \\r\\nFollowing the selection of the \\u201cPrime\\u201d, all countries \\\\(a.k.a. Jurisdictional Country of Service\\\\) across all scope profiles are rolled up into the \\u201cPrime\\u201d to leverage the Client Number while ignoring the Engagement Code. The list is retrieved from the Engagement Service. Submitting the configuration is akin to submitting a provisioning request. The Document Service stores the workspace connector configuration for the GTP engagement, to be retrieved at any time, and proxies a provisioning request to EYI MyDocs API.  \\r\\nOnce one or more connectors are created within the Global Tax Platform, the Document Service manages the connector rather than the workspace. Retrieval of workspace connectors and their relevant information will be done via the Document Service without interaction with EYI MyDocs; however, should this data change in any way ancillary processes may be invoked to reconcile the target workspaces with the new configuration. The connectors will be used to synchronize files between GTP and EYI MyDocs. The provisioning of workspaces and the synchronization of data is outside the scope of this solution.  \\r\\n<u>Discover Workspaces</u>\\r\\n- Document Service \\\\(v3\\\\)\\r\\n- /provisioning/engagements/\\\\{engagementId\\\\}/workspaces\\r\\n- Parameters\\r\\n- engagementId \\u2013 Identity of the GTP engagement\\r\\n- clientId \\u2013 Identity of the GTP Client Site\\r\\n- Request:  \\r\\n\\\\{  \\r\\n  \\\"taxEngagements\\\": \\\\[  \\r\\n    \\\\{  \\r\\n      \\\"taxClientNumber\\\": \\\"string\\\",  \\r\\n      \\\"taxEngagementCode\\\": \\\"string\\\",  \\r\\n      \\\"jurisdiction\\\": \\\"string\\\"  \\r\\n    \\\\}  \\r\\n  \\\\]  \\r\\n\\\\}\\r\\n- Response:  \\r\\n\\\\{  \\r\\n  \\\"gtpEngagementId\\\": \\\"3fa85f64\\\\-5717\\\\-4562\\\\-b3fc\\\\-2c963f66afa6\\\",  \\r\\n  \\\"gtpClientId\\\": 0,  \\r\\n  \\\"sites\\\": \\\\[  \\r\\n    \\\\{  \\r\\n      \\\"isPrimary\\\": true,  \\r\\n      \\\"isRedbox\\\": true,  \\r\\n      \\\"taxClientNumber\\\": \\\"string\\\",  \\r\\n      \\\"engagementCode\\\": \\\"string\\\",  \\r\\n      \\\"jurisdiction\\\": \\\"string\\\",  \\r\\n      \\\"engagementWorkspaces\\\": \\\\[  \\r\\n        \\\\{  \\r\\n          \\\"siteUrl\\\": \\\"string\\\",  \\r\\n          \\\"engagementLibrary\\\": \\\"string\\\",  \\r\\n          \\\"clientWorkspaces\\\": \\\\[  \\r\\n            \\\\{  \\r\\n              \\\"siteUrl\\\": \\\"string\\\",  \\r\\n              \\\"clientLibrary\\\": \\\"string\\\"  \\r\\n            \\\\}  \\r\\n          \\\\],  \\r\\n          \\\"thirdPartyWorkspaces\\\": \\\\[  \\r\\n            \\\\{  \\r\\n              \\\"siteUrl\\\": \\\"string\\\",  \\r\\n              \\\"thirdPartyLibrary\\\": \\\"string\\\"  \\r\\n            \\\\}  \\r\\n          \\\\]  \\r\\n        \\\\}  \\r\\n      \\\\],  \\r\\n      \\\"isNewEws\\\": true,  \\r\\n      \\\"isNewCws\\\": true  \\r\\n    \\\\}  \\r\\n  \\\\]  \\r\\n\\\\}  \\r\\n<u>Save Connectors</u>\\r\\n- Document Service \\\\(v3\\\\)\\r\\n- /provisioning/engagements\\r\\n- Parameters\\r\\n- ClientId \\u2013 Identity of the GTP Client Site\\r\\n- Request:  \\r\\n\\\\{  \\r\\n  \\\"gtpEngagementId\\\": \\\"3fa85f64\\\\-5717\\\\-4562\\\\-b3fc\\\\-2c963f66afa6\\\",  \\r\\n  \\\"gtpClientId\\\": 0,  \\r\\n  \\\"sites\\\": \\\\[  \\r\\n    \\\\{\",\n",
